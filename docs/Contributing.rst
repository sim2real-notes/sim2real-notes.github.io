Please feel free to improve RapidML's code on GitHub_

The preferred way to modify RapidML source is to fork the repository_ and submit the pull request. However, before doing so please update the documentation and release notes, available in the ``docs`` directory.

Areas of improvement:

* Implementing an elegant way of building reStructured Text documentation using Sphinx. The current method involves building the HTML files in the ``docsource`` directory and then using a redirection index to point to the actual index.

* Improve helper tips within RapidML functions.
